          Where \(x\) is what we want to estimate, \(y\) is data we can measure and collect, mapping \(f:x \rightarrow y\) represents <b>Forward Model</b>.
          <br>
          Solving such an <b>Inverse Problem</b> is usually reformulated as solving an <a href="optimization.html"><b>Optimization Problem</b></a>:

          When data \(y\) is somewhat incomplete or even sparse due to some experimental constraint, we need to add some <b>Regularization</b> term, which is similar to <b>Prior</b> in <b>Maximum A Posteriori (MAP)</b> estimation.

          Besides collecting data \(y\), we also need to know <b>Forward Model</b> - [Mathematically how \(x\) is mapped to \(y\)], which may be through an operarion or a combination of operations, including convolutuon, projection, Hadamard product, Fresnel propagation, Fourier transform and so on.
          The forward model should be determined by the specific hardware system and the true underlying physical process.

          <h3>Parameterized Forward Model</h3>
          Depending on applications, forward model is not necessarily associated with a particular hardware system and physical process.
          It can be just a mathematical hypothesis like linear regression model \(y=f(\beta,x)=\beta^T x\), logistic regression model \(y=f(\beta,x)=\sigma(\beta^T x\)) where \(\sigma\) is logistic function, neural network model \(y=f(W_1,b_1...W_L,b_L,x)\) and so on.
          This mathematical hypothesis aims to explore relationship or correlation between input \(x\) and output \(y\).
          We can collect both input \(x\) and output \(y\) to provide training dataset. Our objective instead is to train the model by optimizing its parameters like \(\beta\), so that at a good accuracy the model hopefully is able to estimate or predict output \(y\) with new input \(x\).
          Solving such a <b>Modeling Problem</b> is closely related to the framework of <a href="machineLearning.html"><b>Machine Learning Probelm</b></a>.

          <h1>Electron Interaction with Thick Specimen</h1>
          <p>This section recaps the theory of calculating transmission electron microscope image of thick specimen (more than a few atoms thick),
          including the effects of multiple (or plural) scattering. When the electron can scatter more than once as it passes through the specimen,
          the scattering is said to be dynamical.
          </p>
          <p>The Schrodinger equation for the full wave function \(\Psi_f(x,y,z)\) as a function of
          three spatial coordinates \((x,y,z)\) in an electrostatic potential \(V(x,y,z)\) of the specimen is as follows:
          
          $$[-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2-eV(x,y,z)]\Psi_f(x,y,z)=E\Psi_f(x,y,z)$$
          
          The electron motion will be predominately in the forward z direction (along the optic axis of the microscope)
          and the specimen will be a relatively minor perturbation on the electron's motion.
          It is useful to separate the large velocity in the z direction from other small effects due to the specimen.

          $$\Psi_f(x,y,z)=\Psi(x,y,z)\exp(\frac{2\pi iz}{\lambda})$$

          After cancelling equal terms and dropping common factors, we can have the following equation:
          
          $$[\nabla^2_{xy} + \partial^2_z + \frac{4\pi i}{\lambda}\partial_z + \frac{2meV(x,y,z)}{\hbar^2}]\Psi(x,y,z)=0$$
          
          The motion of the high energy electrons is predominately in the forward z direction meaning that \(\Psi\) changes slowly with z and \(\lambda\) is very small.
          So the above equation may be approximated as a first order differential equation in z:
          
          $$[\nabla^2_{xy} + \frac{4\pi i}{\lambda}\partial_z + \frac{2meV(x,y,z)}{\hbar^2}]\Psi(x,y,z)=0$$
          
          Given an initial value \(\Psi(x,y,z=z_0)\), the above equation then can be solved by numerical method (multislice or finite difference).
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="container p-3 my-3 border" id="Electrodynamics">
          <h1>X-ray Interaction with Thick Specimen</h1>
          <p>
          If the X-ray photon can only scatter once when passing through the specimen, the scattering is said to be kinematical.
          In X-ray Crystallography or X-ray Small Angle Scattering, kinematical scattering is utilized to investigate specimen's structure.
          Although X-ray has relatively strong penetrating power, dynamical scattering also exists in X-ray diffraction of thick specimens.
          </p>
          <p>The Helmholtz equation for the full wave function \(\Psi_f(x,y,z)\) as a function of
          three spatial coordinates \((x,y,z)\) in a complex refractive index \(n(x,y,z)\) of the specimen is as follows:
          
          $$[\nabla^2 + k^2n(x,y,z)^2]\Psi_f(x,y,z)=0, \space where \space n(x,y,z) = 1 - \delta(x,y,z) + i\beta(x,y,z)$$
          
          The term δ is the decrement of the real part of the refractive index, and the imaginary part β describes the absorption index or extinction coefficient.
          When X-rays pass through a specimen, not only their amplitude but their phase is altered as well.
          <br>
          Likewise, it is useful to separate the large velocity in the z direction from other small effects due to the specimen.

          $$\Psi_f(x,y,z)=\Psi(x,y,z)\exp(ikz)$$

          After cancelling equal terms and dropping common factors, we can have the following equation:

          $$[\nabla^2_{xy} + \partial^2_z + 2ik\partial_z + k^2(n^2-1)]\Psi(x,y,z)=0$$

          In similar manner, the above Helmholtz equation may be approximated as a first order differential equation in z:

          $$[\nabla^2_{xy} + 2ik\partial_z + k^2(n^2-1)]\Psi(x,y,z)=0$$

          Given an initial value \(\Psi(x,y,z=z_0)\), the equation then can be solved by numerical method (multislice or finite difference).
          <br>
          <br>
          In addition, if there is no specimen present, then the last term \(k^2(n^2-1)\) in the left-hand side (LHS) can be dropped
          and the equation may be approximated as \([\nabla^2_{xy} + 2ik\partial_z]\Psi(x,y,z)=0\) representing the well-known Fresnel propagation of wave along the z direction in free-space .
          <br>For the X-ray wavelength (or energy), if specimen is not too thick and accumulated propagation effect is small, then the first term \(\nabla^2_{xy}\) in the left-hand side (LHS) can be dropped
          and the equation may be approximated as \([2ik\partial_z + k^2(n^2-1)]\Psi(x,y,z)=0\) representing the well-known projection (or line-integral) of specimen in the z direction.
